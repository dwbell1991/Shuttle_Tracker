// Ports are a transport-layer concept designed to allow many different
// networking applications run at the same time on a single computer.
// More about ports: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)
//
// By default, if it's set, Sails uses the PORT environment variable.
// Otherwise it falls back to port 1337.

// In production, you'll probably want to change this setting
// to 80 (http://) or 443 (https://) if you have an SSL certificate
